# Spigot Case Study
this is a case study for developed for spigot, this application is coded in core java using spring boot and Mysql database.

In this application you can import(or create your own in postman to test) posts from the database(mysql) and then do get/put/patch/delete requests, we can also create entries for the second database with structure given in the description.

please when creating entries use images size less than 64kb, since mysql has problem loading them.
